        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>I am a senior undergraduate student at UMass Amherst majoring in computer science and mathematics. Broadly, I am interested in theoretical computer science and abstract algebra. I will be a Master's student at UMass starting Fall 2025, after which I intend to pursue a PhD somewhere else. My research is focused on computational complexity theory, and in particular on parallel computation and the structure of complexity classes. Currently I am studying threshold computation and connections to algebraic automata theory and descriptive complexity for my honors thesis. I am fortunate to have <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~barring/">David A. Mix Barrington</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/">Eric Allender</a> as my thesis advisors.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>(2024-08-12) The Polymath Jr. program has ended. I am continuing to work on a conjecture we developed throughout the Fall, and the results will be published sometime next Spring.</a>.</li>
            <li>(2024-07-28) I will be attending the DIMACS Frontiers in Complexity Theory workshop at Rutgers University from July 29th through August 1st.</li>
            <li>(2024-07-24) I am participating in a project on combinatorial commutative algebra as part of the <a href="https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu">Polymath Jr. REU</a>.</li>

            <li>Former UMass student and esteemed UCA Ben Burns has some <a href="https://bburns.xyz/blog/umass-advice.html">excellent advice </a>about undergraduate research in theoretical computer science at UMass.</li>
            <li>Professor Jenia Tevelev also has some <a href="https://people.math.umass.edu/~tevelev/grad_advice.html">good advice</a> about undergraduate research in pure mathematics.</li>
            <li>The CICS has a <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/theory/">Theory Group</a> with a weekly seminar that you should go to if you are interested in TCS.</li>
            <li>We have a <a href="https://umass.acm.org/">ACM student chapter</a> at UMass, but no algorithms and computation theory special interest group... someone ought to fix that.</li>
