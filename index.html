        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>I am a senior undergraduate honors student at UMass Amherst majoring in computer science and mathematics. Broadly, I am interested in theoretical computer science and abstract algebra. If you are a UMass student (or anyone really) and want to chat theory, feel free to reach out! I used to be an avid <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2019MAYO03">speedcuber</a>, with an official average of 9.72 on the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. You might still catch  me at New England cubing competitions.</p>
        <p>My research is focused on computational complexity theory, and in particular on parallel computation and the structure of complexity classes. Currently I am studying the power of constant-depth threshold circuits and the complexity of Boolean formula evaluation for my honors thesis. My thesis advisors are <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~barring/">David A. Mix Barrington</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/">Eric Allender</a>. Other topics I am interested in include meta-complexity and applications of "pure mathematics" in complexity (see <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/meta-complexity-basic-introduction-meta-perplexed">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09780">here</a>, respectively).</p>
